# Py3Programming
Python 3 Programming Specialization
is another awesome course offered by the University of Michigan, it teaches the fundamentals of programming in Python 3 
such as variables, conditionals, and loops, keyword parameters, list comprehensions, lambda expressions, and class inheritance etc.\

By the end of the specialization, you’ll be writing programs that query Internet APIs for data and extract useful information from them.  And you’ll be able to learn to use new modules and APIs on your own by reading the documentation.
